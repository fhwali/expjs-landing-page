                        I am consistently working towards an understanding of all aspects of technology. 
                        I am especially fascinated by technologies such as artificial intelligence.
                        I also have a deep interest towards robotics, especially the ones which 
                        could be used as assistive tools for physically challenged. 
                        And my dream is to one day be able to be part of a research team which 
                        is working towards building such equipment. </p>
